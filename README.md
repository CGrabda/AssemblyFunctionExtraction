# AssemblyFunctionExtraction

## Setup

Install dependencies, e.g., using a conda environment named {ENV} & pip
```console
conda create --name {ENV} python=3.10
conda activate {ENV}
pip install r2pipe lief pefile capstone tokenizers
```

## Usage

### Disassembly pipeline

```console
python pipeline.py --file_or_dir="file.exe"
```

```console
python pipeline.py --file_or_dir="directory"         
```

```console
python pipeline.py --help         
```

### Virtual-physical address map

```console
python address.py --build --merge
```

```console
python address.py --help
```

### The program does not work lol

```console
python example.py        
```

## Goals

The goal is to extract disassembled functions from PE executables. We'll want a pure function that takes a file as input and returns disassembled functions, along with their locations in the binary, e.g.,

```python

from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Function:
    """
    Crucial information from each function.

    # TODO: include any information that may be useful.
    """
    instructions: list[str]
    lower_offset: int
    upper_offset: int


def extract_functions_from_binary(file: Path) -> list[Function]:
    """
    Extract disassembled functions and their locations from a PE binary.

    Args:
        file: file to extract from

    Returns:
        information about each function in the file
    """
    ...
```

Eventually, we'll want to parallelize this, so a pure function is easiest to work with.

There are many aspects of this problem that we will need to consider, e.g., architectures, instruction sets, obfuscations, etc. For now, start with the simplest variation of this problem and we'll refine the specifications as we go. Depending on the difficulty of the task, we may be able to write a similar function that extracts basic blocks and write dedicated functions for different architectures, e.g., x86, x64, ARM, etc., or file types, e.g., Android APK, Linux ELF, Mac Mach-O etc.
